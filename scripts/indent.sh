# Apply the formatters, or check that the tree is already where they would put
# it.
#
# One file list and one order, used by `make indent` through --write and by
# scripts/test.sh through --check, so what gets rewritten is what gets checked.
# scripts/git-pre-commit.sh mirrors these lists against the index in its own
# matcher language, and .claude/skills/codetrial-verify/SKILL.md describes them,
# so a lane added here needs adding in both.
#
# The order is not a preference. commentflow puts a blank line before a comment
# that sits inside a method chain, an array literal or an argument list, and
# `cargo fmt` takes that line back out; running the formatters last lets them
# have the final word. That is also why the check runs the whole chain against a
# copy of the tree rather than asking commentflow alone whether it would change
# something: on its own it always would, and the answer would be a gate nobody
# can satisfy.
#
# Style flags are deliberately absent. shfmt reads .editorconfig, which is where
# this repository's shell settings already live, and passing -i here would
# silently override the file for one caller.
