description: Help CodeTrial contributors turn observations into clear English GitHub issues, small contribution plans, and pull request descriptions, and see them through. Use to draft, improve or file a CodeTrial issue, answer what a maintainer asked on it (a revision, a log, an initial analysis, a retest), prepare a PR description, respond to review requests such as rebase, squash or commit message fixes, check which of your own issues and PRs are waiting on you, ask a focused maintainer question, or choose a bounded first contribution with an AI agent. The deliverable is copy-ready text; judging an existing backlog for duplicates is codetrial-triage. Opening a PR goes through gh-submit when it is installed; this skill covers it otherwise.

# Contribute to CodeTrial

CodeTrial is a mock interview platform, and contributing with an AI agent is a
supported way to learn. Start from the contributor's observation or intended
outcome. Explain unfamiliar terms briefly in their language, then produce an
English issue or PR draft they can understand and check. Never make a
questionnaire, skills survey or quiz a prerequisite for help.

Titles, body formatting, issue references and redaction follow
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md); the rules for writing to GitHub,
approval included, are in the GitHub section of
[codetrial-conventions](../codetrial-conventions/SKILL.md). Keep technical
identifiers and quoted errors exact.

Example requests: "Turn these notes into an issue", "Help me make my first
CodeTrial contribution", or "Write a PR description from this diff". Produce
the artifact the user asked for.

## Draft or improve an issue

Check existing open and closed issues and related PRs first, using the retrieval
and comparison workflow in
[codetrial-triage](../codetrial-triage/SKILL.md). If a report already
covers the problem, offer a focused addition to that thread with new evidence.
When the deliverable is instead a verdict on someone else's thread, that comment
is codetrial-triage's. If GitHub access is unavailable, still prepare the
draft and explicitly mark the duplicate search as unverified.

Use the information already available in notes, logs and the checkout. Ask only
for missing facts that change the report's meaning. Never invent reproduction
steps, versions, root causes or successful tests. A plausible explanation is a
hypothesis; observed behavior is evidence.

Choose the smallest useful structure:

- **Bug**: concrete symptom, expected and actual results, numbered minimal
  reproduction steps, relevant version/environment, and a short sanitized error
  or other evidence. Identify the build by revision rather than by date, since
  published binaries move under a rolling tag (`docs/install.md`); triage has why
  that makes a date one-directional. Ask first what the binary reports about
  itself; when it reports nothing, say the revision is unknown and give the exact
  download timestamp, which still bounds the build from above.
  For an interview failure, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.yml` is the field list;
  ask only for the ones that matter. The problem language matters because Python
  and JavaScript run in the browser while C, C++ and Java run remotely, so one
  symptom means two different things across that split. Record frequency or
  regression range when known.
  Unknown details can stay explicitly unknown; a useful report need not
  diagnose a fix. Retest on the current `latest` release or `main` before
  filing: the lobby and the interviewer change daily, and #146 and #171 both
  reported behavior that had already been fixed after the reporter's download.
- **Feature**: who is affected (candidate, operator or contributor) and in which
  workflow, desired outcome, present workaround, scope and observable acceptance
  criteria. Keep a suggested implementation separate from the need it serves.
- **Documentation**: page or section, what is missing or misleading, and the
  intended correction or reader outcome. Do not demand runtime logs for prose.

Do not split a single problem across multiple issues just to fill categories.
Do not combine two problems in one issue either; #151 and #205 each had to be
split after the fact.

## Get the facts a maintainer asks for

These are the requests that recur on this tracker. The contributor may never
have done any of them, so give the exact steps for their platform, run what can
be run in the checkout, and check the result before it is posted.

| Asked for | How to get it |
| --- | --- |
| The revision | `codetrial --version` with the binary that ran, or `cargo run -- --version` in a checkout. It prints `codetrial 0.1.0 (<sha>)`; post that line. |
| The revision of a binary too old for `--version` | Builds before 3ec7cb4 (2026-09-29) print nothing. A saved report's header shows `Contract: bundle N`, and `git log -S'INTERVIEW_CONTRACT_BUNDLE_VERSION: u32 = N;' --format='%h %cI' -- src/agent.rs` gives the commit that set N and the one that replaced it; the build lies between them, as #188 shows. Without a report, give the exact download time, which bounds the build from above. |
| The agent terminal output | The terminal window where `codetrial` is running prints the agent log. Copy the lines around the failure, starting at `starting interview: room=...`. Remove API keys and tokens, and every line that quotes what the candidate said: personal interview content stays out of a public thread even when the contributor would not mind. |
| The browser console | F12 or Ctrl+Shift+J (Cmd+Option+J on macOS) in Chrome and Edge, Ctrl+Shift+K in Firefox; Safari needs Settings, Advanced, "Show features for web developers" first. Copy the text rather than a screenshot. |
| A retest of an open PR | From a checkout: `gh pr checkout <N> --repo sysprog21/codetrial`, or `git fetch https://github.com/sysprog21/codetrial.git pull/<N>/head:pr-<N> && git switch pr-<N>`, then `cargo run -- web`. Report the result on the PR, not on the issue. |
| A retest after a merge | Download the `latest` release again, or `git pull` on `main`, and confirm `--version` names the merge commit or later. |
| An edit to the issue | On the issue page, the `...` menu on the first post, then Edit; or `gh issue edit <N> --repo sysprog21/codetrial --body-file <file>`. Edit in place rather than filing again. |

## Write the initial analysis a maintainer asked for

"Provide an initial analysis and a list of follow-up actions" asks the
contributor to read the code, not the UI. A useful answer has four parts, and
#66, #133 and #211 are worked examples on this tracker:

1. The path: which file and function handle the behavior, found with `git grep`
   on a log line or a UI string the contributor saw. Give `path:line` at a named
   revision.
2. The evidence: the log line, measurement or state that shows where the
   behavior diverges from the expected one.
3. One hypothesis, labeled as such, and the experiment that would refute it.
4. Follow-up actions, each small enough to be a commit or a question.

An agent's summary of the codebase is not an analysis. A maintainer rejected
one on #66 because it had no motivation and no evidence. Post the analysis as a
comment, or fold it into the body, then say which one you did.

Return a copy-ready title and body, followed by any remaining questions outside
the draft. Link related work and explain whether it overlaps or differs. For a
maintainer question, give the context, what was inspected or attempted, and one
specific decision needed to continue.

## Make a first contribution manageable

Offer one bounded task matched to the contributor's stated experience and time,
or a small first step when neither is given. Inspect current code and tests
before naming likely files; a `good first issue` label alone is not proof of
suitable scope.

Give the contributor:

- a visible result, such as a minimal reproduction, focused docs correction or
  regression test and fix;
- likely entry points and a concrete acceptance check;
- a stopping condition and fallback, such as drafting the exact maintainer
  question if the expected behavior is still undecided.

Keep unrelated refactoring out of the task. Do not require filing an issue for
every small, well-understood fix. For uncertain product direction, establish
the desired behavior before investing in a large implementation. When coaching,
help the contributor explain what fails before and succeeds after the change.

## Prepare a pull request people can review

Read the full branch diff against its intended base, relevant commits and linked
issues. Check that the branch contains the intended work only, and use a topic
branch as described in conventions. Preserve unrelated working-tree edits.
AI-generated summaries are starting points: validate every claim against the
diff and actual test results. Do not paste a conversation transcript.

Use [codetrial-verify](../codetrial-verify/SKILL.md) for the appropriate validation
and [codetrial-web](../codetrial-web/SKILL.md) when browser or wire behavior is
involved. Report commands and outcomes, including failures and skipped or unrun
checks with reasons. Local success is not evidence that remote CI passed.

The description should cover:

- the concrete problem and resulting behavior, with a before/after example
  when it clarifies the change;
- the essential implementation choice or tradeoff a reviewer needs to assess;
- validation evidence and material limitations; include screenshots or sanitized
  logs only when they help verify the result;
- relevant compatibility or follow-up work, then the issue reference line.

For a simple PR, one or two paragraphs plus validation is enough. Rewrite the
title and body when scope changes.

## Publish only after the user sees the text

A request to file an issue or open a PR authorizes preparing it; posting still
waits for the approval described in conventions. Show the target repository and
the title and body verbatim. Feedback that changes the draft without saying to
post it gets the revised draft shown again; "change the title to X and submit"
approves the result and needs no second round.

To open a PR, pass the drafted title and body to gh-submit when it is
installed, and tell it the base is `sysprog21/codetrial`, since on a fork its
`origin` is the contributor's copy. Its single confirmation of repository,
branches, commits, title and body is the approval; do not ask separately first.
Without gh-submit, show the same five things, create the PR with
`--repo sysprog21/codetrial --head <fork-owner>:<branch>` after the yes, and
follow with `gh pr checks <N> --repo sysprog21/codetrial --watch` so the
contributor learns whether CI passed rather than just receiving a URL.

For an issue, repeat a narrow search on the title terms just before creating it,
in case someone filed it meanwhile:

```sh
gh issue list --repo sysprog21/codetrial --state all --search '<title terms>' --limit 5 --json number,title
gh issue create --repo sysprog21/codetrial --title "$(cat "$SCRATCH/title.txt")" \
  --body-file "$SCRATCH/issue.md"
```

Finish with the verified URL and the next concrete step, including any
outstanding evidence the contributor can supply. Tell the contributor that
filing starts the work rather than finishing it: a maintainer usually asks
something within a day, and an issue whose question goes unanswered for two
weeks is closed.

## Follow through on what you filed

When a contributor asks what needs their attention, or comes back to an issue
or PR, start from the same snapshots triage uses, filtered to them:

```sh
me=$(gh api user --jq .login)
.claude/skills/codetrial-triage/issue-sweep.sh |
  jq --arg me "$me" '.waiting[] | select(.author == $me)'
gh pr list --repo sysprog21/codetrial --author "@me" \
  --json number,title,reviewDecision,mergeable,updatedAt
```

`pr-sweep.sh` is no help for one's own pull requests: it leaves out the viewer's
PRs, since its nudges and rebase requests are a maintainer's to send. A PR whose
`reviewDecision` is `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or whose `mergeable` is `CONFLICTING`
is waiting on its author.

For each hit, read the newest maintainer comment and do what it asks, using the
table above. Answer it in that thread, quoting the question when the thread has
several. A fact that belongs in the report also goes into the body by editing
it, so the next reader does not need the comments. When a maintainer links a
PR that may fix the issue, retest it and say on the PR whether it does. When a
fix merged and the retest passes, say so with the `--version` line, and close
the issue if a maintainer has not. An open issue nobody can confirm stays on
everyone's list.

## Answer a review

Most review requests here are about git and the commit message, not about the
code, and they recur. What each asks:

- "Rebase latest `main` and resolve conflicts": find the remote that points at
  `sysprog21/codetrial` in `git remote -v`. On a fork it is usually missing, so
  add it with
  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sysprog21/codetrial.git`; in a
  clone of upstream itself it is `origin`, so use that name wherever `upstream`
  appears below. Then `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main`,
  resolve each conflict, `./scripts/test.sh`, and
  `git push --force-with-lease`. A merge commit from `main` is not a rebase.
- "Squash" or "fold similar commits": one commit per functional change, with the
  review fixups folded into the commit they fix. `git rebase -i upstream/main`
  is the tool. An agent that cannot drive an interactive editor can run
  `git reset --soft "$(git merge-base HEAD upstream/main)"` and commit again, but
  only when the result is meant to be a single commit. Show the contributor the
  new `git log` before pushing.
- "Read cbea.ms/git-commit" or "refine commit messages": run
  `./scripts/git-commit-msg.sh --rules`, then `make hooks` so the next commit is
  checked before it leaves the machine. The body says what and why. The
  conversation that produced the change stays out of it, and so do
  `Co-Authored-By` trailers and "Generated with" lines for an AI tool.
- "Run `make indent`": run it, check that `git diff` shows only formatting, and
  amend the commit that introduced the code rather than adding a "format"
  commit.
- "Append `Closes #N`" or "avoid `Refs`": put `Closes #N` alone on the last line
  of the commit message as well as the PR body, when the change finishes the
  issue. `Refs #N` is for a change that does not, and then the body says what
  is left; a bare `Refs: #60` told the reviewer nothing.
- A question in a review thread: answer it in that thread. A changed line
  answers itself, so resolve the thread rather than replying "done".

Replies follow the register in CONTRIBUTING.md, and maintainers here enforce it
in public. A reply opens with the fact. It carries no greeting, thanks, apology
("Sorry for the delay"), self-introduction ("my first issue"), or list of what
the last push changed. Maintainers called out each of those on #83, #94, #123,
#185 and #60.
