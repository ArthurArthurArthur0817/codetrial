# Read-only snapshot of the open pull requests for the triage sweep. Writes
# nothing to GitHub; pulls.md says which of the actions it lists a sweep applies
# on its own and which wait for the user.
#
# Usage: pr-sweep.sh [repo] [stale-days] (default sysprog21/codetrial, 7)
#
# Prints one JSON object:
#   approve   runs waiting for approval on the current head of an open PR, and
#             whether its author is a first-time contributor
#   outdated  unresolved review threads whose lines the PR no longer touches
#   overlap   PR pairs that close the same issue
#   stale     PRs, not the viewer's or a deleted account's, whose last visible
#             human review or comment from someone other than the author is
#             newer than anything the author did and older than stale-days,
#             unless the latest verdict is an approval, it is the rebase
#             request on a PR that still conflicts, or the activity was cut
#             off at 100
#   rebase    non-draft PRs against the default branch that conflict with it
#             and whose head moved since the last rebase request, or that never
#             got one
#   hide      earlier rebase requests that a newer one supersedes, including
#             every one on a PR in rebase, which gets a new request
#   hide_ask  other changes-requested reviews mentioning rebase on a PR that
#             has or is about to get the fixed one: hand-written ones, and
#             fixed-text ones with inline comments; they may carry more
#   unknown   PRs whose mergeability GitHub has not computed yet; rerun
#   prs       number, title, updatedAt, head, author, closing issues and files
#             of every open PR, for judging overlap that shares no issue and
#             for checking a PR again before writing to it

# A thread reply is a review by its writer, so author replies show up in
# reviews. A review records the head it was left on, so a head that moved since
# says exactly that someone pushed after it. pushedDate is always null now, and
# a commit date says when a commit was made rather than pushed, so the latest
# force push or commit date is only the fallback after a plain comment.
