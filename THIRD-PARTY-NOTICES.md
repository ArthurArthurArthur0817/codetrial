the version or commit named in their `FETCH` manifests, and accepted only when
they match the adjacent `SHA256SUMS`. The LiveKit client and the three-vrm
bundle are committed and pinned in place.

License texts and source details are shipped with the relevant assets:

- `web/vendor/LICENSE-apache-2.0.txt` (LiveKit client, MediaPipe, pdf.js)
- `web/vendor/avatar/LICENSE-three.txt`
- `web/vendor/avatar/LICENSE-three-vrm.txt`

Compiler Explorer is a remote service, not bundled software. C, C++, and Java
source is sent to it only when remote test runs are enabled.
