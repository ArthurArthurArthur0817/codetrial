// Jim's avatar behavior, with no Three.js and no DOM types beyond the mount's

// failure, and a real timeout without a browser.
//
// The model handle this talks to is one method wide: `apply(pose)` once per
// frame, plus `dispose()`. A pose object beats eight setters because the whole
// frame arrives at the renderer atomically and a test can assert it by value.

// Bounds how long a load may stay adoptable, not how long the candidate waits:
// the neutral panel is on screen for every state except `ready`, so nothing is
// staring at a spinner. That is why this is generous. An 11 MB model needs
// 8 seconds only at 11 Mbps, and at the 3 Mbps an ordinary connection actually
// delivers it needs about 30, so a shorter deadline sent every such candidate
// to the neutral panel while the download ran to completion anyway and was
// then thrown away.
//
// 60 and not 30 because the download is no longer local. The deadline now has
// to cover a round trip to the model's upstream host, the SHA-256 of 11 MB,
// and the parse, and 30 was the download alone at the connection speed above.
// Getting this wrong is close to invisible: the cache makes the second attempt
// succeed, so whoever tests it twice never sees the first one fail.
